### Why I Chose Pong As A Browswer Game
#### I chose Pong due to me thinking when I was younger that if I were to start coding a game that I would want to code Pong first. 
#### I've alway though of making a Mario esk game but starting at the roots of the first game I played even when Rachet and Clank of the PS2 was right next to me...
#### I've always thought that I could make Pong myself!
### *Game Discription*
#### All there is to really know how to play is that if you are by-yourself, you use the W and S key to move the left pong up and down.
#### If you have anyone close to you and enjoy the good ol 1 computer yet 2 kids days of lan in games, you can use the W and S keys for left pong and Up and Down Arrow for right pong
### *Game Features I Made My Own*
#### I didn't know how to amke the game my own at first but then I thought of the common features that just come apart of any games these days
* Could I switch between multiplayer and vs the computer?
* Could I change the difficulty to make the game harder
* Can I change the dynamics of the game as it progreses
#### Granted I wasn't able to get to the last point but I would like to implement something of the sort in the future
#### I did accomplish the first 2 items though!
* To switch difficulty use the drop down option when you click on eazy (the default diff)
* The switch to muliplayer just click on the radio check box and you should now notice that your arrows will move the right pong
##### Good to note that you will have to use the restart button a lot if you want to reset the game or want to choose a different difficulty or press pause a bunch!
### *What I Would Want To Improve Next Time*
* Add a code to chang eof the game appears whent the score changes (similar to how this [YT creator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrqN0uZwhwk&t=625s&ab_channel=Devression) did his game)
* I would also want to add more variety to the options I provided to the user. For Example, maybe to change the color of the pong or ball, maybe even the background of their choice!
